# lab-1806-vec-db

Rust Implementation for Lab 1806 Vector Database

## Development with Rust

```bash
# Install Rustup
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# Then install the rust-analyzer extension in VSCode.
# You may need to set "rust-analyzer.runnables.extraEnv" in VSCode Machine settings.
# The value should be like {"PATH":""} and make sure that `/home/YOUR_NAME/.cargo/bin` is in it.
# Otherwise you may fail when press the `Run test` button.

# Run tests
# Add `-r` to test with release mode
cargo test
# Or you can click the 'Run Test' button in VSCode to show output
```
